Studying these languages provides a firm foundation for an extensive examination of object-oriented language support in C++ and Ada 95. It explains what alternatives are available to the language designer, how language constructs should be used in terms of safety and readability, how language constructs are implemented and which ones can be efficiently compiled and the role of language in expressing and enforcing abstractions. The final chapters introduce functional (ML) and logic (Prolog) programming languages to demonstrate that imperative languages are not conceptual necessities for programming.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"OTHER","identifier":"UOM:39015037286278"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":false},"pageCount":384,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Computers"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"0.9.6.0.preview.0","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mIxQAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mIxQAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com.eg/books?id=mIxQAAAAMAAJ&q=programming&dq=programming&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com.eg/books?id=mIxQAAAAMAAJ&dq=programming&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Understanding_Programming_Languages.html?hl=&id=mIxQAAAAMAAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"EG","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"EG","viewability":"NO_PAGES","embeddable":false,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":false},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=mIxQAAAAMAAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"NONE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"This book compares constructs from C with constructs from Ada in terms of levels of abstractions."}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"ZQigDwAAQBAJ","etag":"y50qAp1Y6V0","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/ZQigDwAAQBAJ","volumeInfo":{"title":"Modern Programming: Object Oriented Programming and Best Practices","subtitle":"Deconstruct object-oriented programming and use it with other programming paradigms to build applications","authors":["Graham Lee"],"publisher":"Packt Publishing Ltd","publishedDate":"2019-06-28","description":"Discover the untapped features of object-oriented programming and use it with other software tools to code fast, efficient applications.

Updated to cover the new features of C# 4.0, including dynamic binding, named and optional parameters, and covariant and contravariant generic types, this release takes the language to the next level by adding the ability to cleanly write programs that don’t rely on static type definitions. This allows dynamic programming languages such as Python, Ruby, and JavaScript to feel native to C#. The C# Programming Language, Fourth Edition, continues to be the authoritative and annotated technical reference for C# 4.0. 7nbsp; Written by Anders Hejlsberg, the language’s architect, and his colleagues, Mads Torgersen, Scott Wiltamuth, and Peter Golde, this volume has been completely updated for C# 4.0. The book provides the complete specification of the language, along with descriptions, reference materials, code samples, and annotations from twelve prominent C# gurus. The many annotations bring a depth and breadth of understanding rarely found in any programming book. As the main text of the book introduces the concepts of the C# language, cogent annotations explain why they are important, how they are used, how they relate to other languages, and even how they evolved. This book is the definitive, must-have reference for any developer who wants to understand C#.

The message from educators, the tech community, and even politicians is clear: everyone should learn to code. To emphasize the universality and importance of computer programming, promoters of coding for everyone often invoke the concept of “literacy,” drawing parallels between reading and writing code and reading and writing text. In this book, Annette Vee examines the coding-as-literacy analogy and argues that it can be an apt rhetorical frame. The theoretical tools of literacy help us understand programming beyond a technical level, and in its historical, social, and conceptual contexts. Viewing programming from the perspective of literacy and literacy from the perspective of programming, she argues, shifts our understandings of both. Computer programming becomes part of an array of communication skills important in everyday life, and literacy, augmented by programming, becomes more capacious. Vee examines the ways that programming is linked with literacy in coding literacy campaigns, considering the ideologies that accompany this coupling, and she looks at how both writing and programming encode and distribute information. She explores historical parallels between writing and programming, using the evolution of mass textual literacy to shed light on the trajectory of code from military and government infrastructure to large-scale businesses to personal use. Writing and coding were institutionalized, domesticated, and then established as a basis for literacy. Just as societies demonstrated a “literate mentality” regardless of the literate status of individuals, Vee argues, a “computational mentality” is now emerging even though coding is still a specialized skill.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780262036245"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"026203624X"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"pageCount":375,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Computers"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"1.3.3.0.preview.1","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YXQsDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=YXQsDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com.eg/books?id=YXQsDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=programming&hl=&cd=8&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com.eg/books?id=YXQsDwAAQBAJ&dq=programming&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/Coding_Literacy.html?hl=&id=YXQsDwAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"EG","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"EG","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com.eg/books/download/Coding_Literacy-sample-pdf.acsm?id=YXQsDwAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=YXQsDwAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"In this book, Annette Vee examines the coding-as-literacy analogy and argues that it can be an apt rhetorical frame."}},{"kind":"books#volume","id":"u13hVoYVZa8C","etag":"Tgf41H1gxEs","selfLink":"https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes/u13hVoYVZa8C","volumeInfo":{"title":"Planning Extreme Programming","authors":["Kent Beck","Martin Fowler"],"publisher":"Addison-Wesley Professional","publishedDate":"2001","description":"Without careful ongoing planning, the software development process can fall apart.

Examines imperative features such as references, concurrency features such as fork, and reactive features such as event handling. Covers language features that express differing perspectives of thinking about computation, including those of logic programming and flow-based programming. Presumes Java programming experience and understanding of object-oriented classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and static classes. Each chapter corresponds with a working implementation of a small programming language allowing students to follow along.","industryIdentifiers":[{"type":"ISBN_13","identifier":"9780262045452"},{"type":"ISBN_10","identifier":"0262045451"}],"readingModes":{"text":false,"image":true},"pageCount":305,"printType":"BOOK","categories":["Computers"],"maturityRating":"NOT_MATURE","allowAnonLogging":false,"contentVersion":"1.2.1.0.preview.1","panelizationSummary":{"containsEpubBubbles":false,"containsImageBubbles":false},"imageLinks":{"smallThumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XLZNEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=5&edge=curl&source=gbs_api","thumbnail":"http://books.google.com/books/content?id=XLZNEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api"},"language":"en","previewLink":"http://books.google.com.eg/books?id=XLZNEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=programming&hl=&cd=10&source=gbs_api","infoLink":"http://books.google.com.eg/books?id=XLZNEAAAQBAJ&dq=programming&hl=&source=gbs_api","canonicalVolumeLink":"https://books.google.com/books/about/An_Experiential_Introduction_to_Principl.html?hl=&id=XLZNEAAAQBAJ"},"saleInfo":{"country":"EG","saleability":"NOT_FOR_SALE","isEbook":false},"accessInfo":{"country":"EG","viewability":"PARTIAL","embeddable":true,"publicDomain":false,"textToSpeechPermission":"ALLOWED","epub":{"isAvailable":false},"pdf":{"isAvailable":true,"acsTokenLink":"http://books.google.com.eg/books/download/An_Experiential_Introduction_to_Principl-sample-pdf.acsm?id=XLZNEAAAQBAJ&format=pdf&output=acs4_fulfillment_token&dl_type=sample&source=gbs_api"},"webReaderLink":"http://play.google.com/books/reader?id=XLZNEAAAQBAJ&hl=&source=gbs_api","accessViewStatus":"SAMPLE","quoteSharingAllowed":false},"searchInfo":{"textSnippet":"Using Java as the implementation language, Rajan covers a range of emerging topics, including concurrency, Big Data, and event-driven programming."}}]
